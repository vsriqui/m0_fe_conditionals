# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

* I feel pretty confident when it comes to this, except for strictly equal and not strictly equal it's standard math symbols.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

* It's pretty straightforward.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

* I understand them. Just in terms of syntax and correctness I'll practice more.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

* I took longer, but 90% of that longer time was doing the spicy challenge.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

* Just working on syntax and correctness mostly. I think I have plent of time to work on it. I've been using the time between EOS Reflection and next segment class for reinforcement. Additionally I find each time I have to build off something I learned earlier I feel way more confident in the past learning.


1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

* I can't think of anything off the top of my head to conclude this assignment. But I know I can comfortably pose questions to class and instructors if I can't google my way out of the question at this point :).
